This repository contains some demo games written in JavaScript (WebGL2), with the help of an extension [math library](https://github.com/szecsi/WebGLMath).


## Tank battle

A 2D top-view shooter game, involving bouncing tanks, pellets and EXPLOOOSION[!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jar1LTxxAeM)

## Cars and planets

Have you ever dreamed about driving a Chevrolet on the [Heroes' Square (Budapest)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes%27_Square_(Budapest)), while knocking away bouncing mini planets?
I'm sure you have. But now you even have the chance to try it out! Although, only on the computer screen.

## Car in water

The car is the same as before. But now the city is flooded, and trees grow out of the Square. You should escape while you can!

## Others

There are some other cool demos, such as dancing zombies, flying mercury balls, or a car followed by bunch of tires, but these did not get into the top3.
